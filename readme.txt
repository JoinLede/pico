Intelligent popups and landing pages to fully manage email signups, newsletters, subscriptions, donations, and memberships.


== Description ==

Pico gives you all the tools you need to turn your site into an audience business.
No need to redesign your site, learn to code, or hire a developer.


= FOR EMAIL SIGNUPS and NEWSLETTERS =

**Register users while you collect emails.**
Pico’s email pop-ups and landing pages register users on your site in seconds (no password needed).

**Offer free and paid newsletters side by side.**
Easily offer any combination of free and paid newsletters.

**Engagement data that matter.**
Transform your email list into a sales funnel. Keep track of how often a user visits, when they last visited your site, and even what content categories they read the most.

**Easy on-site integration.**
Use Pico’s pre-made templates, with high-converting Facebook and Google sign-in buttons built-in. Or connect with your own email embed forms on site with just one line of code.


= FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS and MEMBERSHIPS =

**The easiest way to sell access to your content.**
Launch a subscription paywall or membership program in minutes with checkout flows that are sure to convert.

**Manage members and leads in the same place.**
Pico is the only subscription and membership tool with a built-in CRM that helps you keep track of who’s paying and _who’s about to pay_.

**Expand your customer base with group subscriptions.**
Pico makes it easy to sell subscriptions to groups of any size. Sell to schools, local businesses, corporations, or other large groups. Pico can validate by code, domain, or email.

**Just want to collect donations?**
Pico is the easiest way to offer donations via Stripe directly on your site or via landing page. All with Pico’s CRM and email signup tools built in.

**Effortless setup. No coding required.**
Pico can be up and running on your site in minutes. And the Pico Publisher App makes setting up all types of models – from multiple pricing tiers, metered paywalls, ‘freemium’ access, and trials – a breeze.
